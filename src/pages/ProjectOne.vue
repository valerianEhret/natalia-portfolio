          <span>WHAT IS MISSING</span><br />
          <span>(FaceTime family stories)</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          What is missing? I found different families and talked about this
          topic with each one. It was the beginning of the first covid pandemic
          in the spring and summer of 2020, so I filmed all the guys virtually,
          via FaceTime mobile messenger: they set up their iPhone in their room
          as possible and as I suggested they do, then entered the frame, did
          something - I peeked in and took the pictures. It was very symbolic
          because I was clearly "missing something". For example, enough control
          over the composition of the shot or its lighting.

          1)Natasha, Sergei and Daniil. Novosibirsk, Russia. Sergei graduated
          from a children's military school and has a bad sense of domestic
          disorder. Natasha is interested in psychology and likes talking openly
          about her emotions but rarely manages to do so as a couple with
          Sergei. Daniil likes putting his toy cars in the living room and won't
          let anyone remove them from the sofa.

          2)Nadya, Pasha, Marusya and Sonya. Novosibirsk, Russia. Nadya combines
          a small home confectionery business, a job as a dentist, her
          children's sport activities and the delivery of sweet orders to her
          clients. Pasha is an ice hockey player, graduating from high school
          and having a hard time with his puberty. Marusya and Sonya are twins.
          They learn figure skating, sing folk songs, and occasionally
          participate in film castings.

          3)Masha, Kostya and Alyona. Moscow, Russia. Masha makes ceramic
          things, learns to draw professionally and one day plans to see
          American sequoias. Because of the strict lockdown in Moscow in spring
          2020 the guys move to the country house to live with their parents and
          relatives, from where Kostya tries to work. He jokes that he will soon
          be working from the toilet - it's so hard for him to concentrate.
          Sometimes Masha sets up dinner with candles and wine. Alyona has just
          started going to kindergarten, and on the set, she shows off her toys
          and talks a lot about herself.

          4)Nadya and Tatiana. Novosibirsk, Russia. Tatiana is a lonely old
          woman. Sometimes she gets sick and calls an ambulance to get a
          painkiller shot and to experience some self-care. Nadia lives at
          Tatjana's place for free, taking care of the flat, trying to be home
          rarely and never inviting anyone to visit. To get into her own, Nadia
          must go through Tatjana's room.

          5)Nadya and Kostya. Novosibirsk, Russia. Nadya and Kostya are married
          and are also business partners. In their common business, she is
          responsible for accounting and paperwork, he for management and
          quality of service. Kostya prefers to spend her holidays camping, in a
          team kayak in a mountain river, Nadia in a sidewalk caf√© in Italy,
          watching people from the sidelines. Time away from work is almost
          impossible for both of them.

          6) Liza, Ilya and Robert. Herten, Germany. Ilya, who immigrated a few
          years ago, is a Russian German: he has learned the language, found a
          job and rented a nice flat. Liza is an Instagram doula and recently
          moved in with Ilya from St. Petersburg - before that, Ilya was
          visiting her regularly in Russia. Robert is only a year old, and it's
          hard for a couple to have some time together outside of their home
          routine.

          7)Gabit and Aliya. Zhitikara, Kazakhstan. Gabit is a medical student,
          an amateur journalist and a Remarque fan. He confesses that he finds
          himself with his phone in his hand more and more often, and his books
          are "waiting for their time", as are his planned trips. Aliya, Gabit's
          sister, also a student, is thumbing through a geographical atlas and
          talking about her father, who often used to show them a world map when
          they were kids. Their father has been working in a foreign city for a
          long time now. Dad's big slippers are standing by the sofa to the
          side.

          8) Asya. Ivanovo, Russia. Artist, media designer and 2D-animator. Asya
          recently gave up painting commercial portraits completely and posted a
          performance video of herself dousing one of her finished portraits
          with white paint. She ironically says she doesn't mind world fame as
          an artist, but is embarrassed to admit it even to herself. Asya is
          intimidated by the demands of being a woman in a family and would not
          want to have a family just to live together. She lives in an
          apartment-atelier and is currently creating her own animated film
          about the female planet Moon, which an astronaut is trying to take
          over.

          9)Tanya, Lyosha and Anya. Novosibirsk, Russia. Tanya loves pranks,
          black humour and misses her parents from the countryside. Lyosha
          reacts painfully to jokes and misses the time when their relationship
          was a carefree time when they scratched each other's backs. Tanya
          admits that sometimes there are "emotional shakes" in their couple,
          right down to broken glass in the door or a torn T-shirt. Anya looks
          into her parents' blanket house with interest and dances happily with
          a scarf around them.

          10)Masha, Ilya and Ksyusha. Saint Petersburg, Russia. Masha is a
          psychologist, a former florist and a young mother. Ilya works in IT
          and often brings Masha to tears with his funny remarks. For a long
          time, they have been living in a flat with a tiny kitchen where they
          can't even put a table for breakfast. They usually cook here and go to
          their room. Ksyusha is already very good at walking on her own and
          often looks into the kitchen. To keep her busy, Masha gives her a bag
          of lentils and lets the child crumble it, knead it and even taste it.

      Between 18 and 21 August 1991 ordinary Soviet citizens were anxious: while
      Tchaikovsky's ballet Swan Lake was being repeated on all TV channels for
      three of those days, the fate of the whole country was being decided in
      the Kremlin. Only when everything had happened was it announced that the
      Soviet Union no longer existed and that all the former republics had
      gained their independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the shock of the post-Soviet nineties, when Coca-Cola was already
      in place but no money for it yet. Almost all the inefficient Soviet
      factories were abruptly shut down, leaving millions of people jobless.
      People simply took everything out of their homes and tried to sell or
      exchange it for food. Often bankrupt businesses paid their salaries in
      products, as was the case with my mother, who regularly brought home cuts
      of old-fashioned, barbed suit cloth from her dying textile factory. One
      day we were a little luckier: my stepfather brought home a whole box of
      oiled sardine liver.
    </p>
    <div class="item item_17">
      <img
        class="img2"
        :src="
          require('../img/my_mothers_dress/(100x66,66)_NataliaEhret_AufDiePlaetzeKurs.jpg')
        "
      />

      The market economy, which did not exist in Soviet times, was just
      beginning to take its first unsure steps. Those who were bolder and
      younger tried their hand at small retail: they went to Turkey, China and
      Eastern European countries, bought clothes there and sold them back home.
      After the standard cotton dresses and Soviet school uniforms, there seemed
      suddenly to be jeans, colourful jumpers, snickers - everything that was
      either forbidden or impossible to get in Soviet times.
    </p>
    <p>
      My project is an attempt to process this childhood trauma: to visualize
      how I perceive these old things now, to digest my post-Soviet childhood. I
      reflect both on the traumatic school uniform, on the strictly gendered New
      Year's Eve snowflake and bunny costumes, and on how difficult it was to
      show an individuality. In fashion photographs, I try to aerialize the
      "old" clothes that many people of my generation and culture, and myself
      included, have complicated, painful feelings about. It helps me to
      recognize my past and no longer see it in terms of victimhood, it removes
      the resentment I felt toward my parents, time, and situation.

      Since February 2022, everything has changed. In my life, in the lives of
      my Ukrainian contacts and friends and in the history of my country,
      Russia. At first, I decided that my rag-tag project, with its almost
      imperial, nostalgic memories, was totally inappropriate and not worth
      finishing and showing. But when international brands announced their exit
      from Russia and my co-citizens formed huge queues at IKEA, Zara and
      Uniqlo, instead of all protesting together in some way against the war or
      blocking their social media and press, it scratched me hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw that my generation, once traumatised by childhood poverty, does not
      yet see the value in democracy and freedom. In democracy and freedom,
      which in those three days between August 18 and 21, 1991, unfortunately,
      were apparently given to us too easily. That the unspoken pact of the oil
      2000s "we let you earn, dress, mortgage and go to the sea - you are not
      interested in politics" still works.
